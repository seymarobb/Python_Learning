# hello-world-learning
# This is my first repository that I use to put my first small projects I did to learn programming and other things.
# These are written by me, but some parts of them may be given by instuctors I follow or taken from other repositories to build on. In any case, since these are very small projects, they only serve to remind me of what I have done and show others who wants to learn these subjects, what kinds of things they can do.
